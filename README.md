Common Ingestion Pipeline with AWS CDK

To enable data analytics and AI/ML there are multiple steps a business has to take to create the foundations necessary to utilize all the data across the company. The process is known as Extract, Transform and Load (ETL), which helps business take their data from all the different providers and perform cleaning. The cleaning phase allows the business to structure the data and contextualize the data for useful analytics such as predictive analysis. In this project, I will be creating a simplified architecture to perform these steps using infrastructure as code, AWS CDK. The AWS CDK is a new software development framework from AWS, which allows developers to build cloud infrastructure using their favorite programming language. AWS CDK support multiple languages, such as, JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, C#, and Java.
